        <p>
          I am a 25-year-old UX/UI designer who is also skilled in front-end development. I have a strong passion for user-centred design, research and problem solving. Group projects at the university have not only taught me good research techniques and
          project management but also how to be a team leader and work as part of a group. For over three years I have been involved in the EU funded RES-Q+ project, which focuses on the improvement of post-stroke care worldwide through digital solutions
          such as conversational agents or natural language processing systems.
