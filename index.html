        <p>
          I am a 25-year-old UX/UI designer who is also skilled in front-end development. I have a strong passion for
          user-centred design, research and problem solving. Group projects at the university have not only taught me
          good research techniques and
          project management but also how to be a team leader and work as part of a group. For over three years I have
          been involved in the EU funded RES-Q+ project, which focuses on the improvement of post-stroke care worldwide
          through digital solutions
          such as conversational agents or natural language processing systems.

            Shift Scheduling App
          </h1>
        </header>

        <h2 class="project-sub-title">Project Goal:</h2>
        <p>
          I designed a system tailored for the shift planner in a print workshop, focusing on
          efficient scheduling and workforce overview. The main priority was to create a user-friendly interface for
          the shift manager, allowing quick planning of both regular workers and temporary staff. While the solution
          (see sketches)
          also considers the needs of department heads and temporary workers, the primary emphasis was on the shift
          planner’s experience. The initial visual concept was created in Figma for both desktop and mobile views.
        </p>

        <h2 class="project-sub-title">Design Strategy:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Identify User Needs:</strong> To tackle this design task, I began by identifying the key user
            needs—focusing primarily on the shift planner. In a real-world scenario, I would typically conduct user
            interviews or observe shift planning in action (e.g., on paper or in existing tools) to understand the task
            flow, key priorities, and common challenges. This helps ensure that the solution is tailored to the actual
            user workflow and uncovers pain points or opportunities for improvement in the current process.

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Create System Requirements:</strong> Based on the user needs I had previously identified, I created
            a set of system requirements to guide the design. For example, the shift planner needs to be able to easily
            assign
            available personnel to shifts, quickly identify if any shift is missing key workers, and make fast
            adjustments
            such as swapping shifts. It's also important to provide a clear overview of employee availability and
            workload, especially in physically demanding environments where overworking staff must be avoided.
            Additionally, the system should support fair distribution of hours, particularly for part-time or temporary
            workers.

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Design sketching:</strong>
            I created a series of basic design sketches to explore the key features and overall layout of elements on
            the screen. These early visual drafts helped me think through the user interface, prioritize functionality,
            and begin shaping a clear structure for the shift planning experience.

              <img src="images/ShiftApp/sketch2.webp" class="shadow-lg mb-2" alt="" srcset=""></span>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>UI Design in Figma:</strong> I designed the user interface in Figma with a strong focus on usability
            for the shift planner. The interface allows users to add workers to shifts, drag and drop both workers and
            shifts, and clearly indicates if a shift is missing required personnel. The weekly schedule is easy to
            navigate, with the option to switch between weeks seamlessly. A sidebar provides quick access to worker
            availability and the number of assigned shifts per employee. To prevent confusion during planning, workers
            only see schedules once finalized—planners can set a date range (e.g., a week, month, or three months) and
            send the schedule when ready. Before sending, the system automatically checks for unfilled shifts to ensure
            completeness.

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Creating an App Design:</strong>
            I also created mobile versions of the interface, focusing on maintaining visual and interaction consistency
            with the web app. Given the limited screen space on mobile, I adapted the
            layout to display one day at a time, allowing users to swipe horizontally between weekdays. To switch
            between weeks, users can use arrow buttons or select from a dropdown. The "Send Schedule" action is
            positioned at the bottom for easy access. Features with lower priority, such as worker availability and
            shift counts per employee, are accessible via two icons in the top right corner, requiring an additional
            interaction to keep the main screen clean and focused.

        <h2 class="project-sub-title">Project Goal:</h2>
        <p>
          I have designed a shared expenses app with my partner after we struggled to find one with good usability and
          design. Together, we are implementing and refining it to be simple, sleek, and easy to use—perfect for groups
          settling costs, like trips where everyone pays for something.
        </p>

        <h2 class="project-sub-title">Group Expense Screen:</h2>
        <span class="image fit rounded"><img class="scale rounded" src="images/chat.webp" alt="" /></span>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Search previous expenses:</strong> Identified the need for users to verify existing expenses and
            designed a search feature that supports quick lookup, helping prevent duplicates and improve clarity in the
            expense tracking flow.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Overview of Total Expenses Amount:</strong> Recognized that the amount is the most critical piece of
            information for users when reviewing expenses. Designed the layout to ensure the amount remains visible at
            all times, reducing cognitive load and helping users stay oriented as they interact with the interface.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reminder System to Nudge Users:</strong> Observed that group members often forgot to settle their
            shared expenses. To address this, I introduced a user-friendly reminder feature that allows users to ping
            others who haven’t paid yet—making it easier to follow up without awkwardness and keeping payments on track.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clear Color Coding:</strong> To reduce ambiguity and improve at-a-glance understanding, I introduced
            a clear color-coded system indicating whether a user owes money or is set to receive it. This visual
            distinction helps users quickly grasp their status without needing to read through details.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="project-sub-title">New Expense Creation:</h2>
        <span class="image fit rounded"><img class="scale rounded" src="images/split.webp" alt="" /></span>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Recent Expense Preview to Prevent Duplicates:</strong> To help users avoid accidentally adding the
            same expense twice, I designed a feature that surfaces the most recent expense with the same name as you're
            typing. This gives immediate context and reduces the chance of duplicates being created.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>One-Tap Shortcut for Even Splits:</strong> Recognizing that evenly splitting expenses is the most
            common use case, I added a quick-access shortcut to simplify the process. This reduces friction and speeds
            up the flow, letting users divide costs with a single tap.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flexible Custom Splits for Uneven Expenses:</strong> To support more complex scenarios like
            splitting by percentage or covering specific shares, I designed a custom split option. This feature gives
            users full control over how expenses are divided, ensuring fairness and adaptability for any situation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clear Payout Flow: Who Pays and Who Gets Paid:</strong> To avoid confusion during settlements, I
            focused on making it easy to distinguish between payers and receivers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tagging System for Smarter Organization and Insights:</strong> Introduced a tagging feature that
            lets users categorize expenses—making it easier to search by type or context. Beyond organization, this also
            lays the groundwork for future data visualizations, like tracking spending trends across categories or
            months.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="project-sub-title">Quick Overview:</h2>
        <span class="image fit rounded"><img class="scale rounded" style="height: auto; width: 60%; margin: auto;"
            src="images/overview.webp" alt="" /></span>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Expense Overview for Clear Group Balances:</strong> Designed an overview screen that summarizes who
            owes what within the group. This high-level view helps users quickly understand outstanding balances,
            reducing confusion and making it easier to settle up.
          </li>
        </ol>
