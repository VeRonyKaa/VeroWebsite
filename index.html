          <p>
            I am a 22-year-old student at Aalborg University. I have a strong
            passion for design and art but I also enjoy math and problem
            solving. Group projects at the university have not only taught me
            good research techniques and project management but also how to be a
            team leader and work as part of a group.

            Medialogy is a unique study that equips its students with skills
            from multiple fields of expertise. Programming, interface design,
            data analysis, cinematography and artificial intelligence are some
            of the various courses taken. Additionally, not only do students
            learn how to work and be part of a team, they also get an
            understanding of how to conduct research, design a project,
            implement a product, evaluate and analyze data. As part of the exam
            students are taught to present and reflect on their project, which
            is an important process for improving one's skills.

              I consider myself both lucky and unlucky as I have experienced
              almost half of my education during the COVID-19 outbreak. It was
              very difficult to keep myself and my team motivated throughout
              this period as nobody really knew how to approach education and
              project work in a pandemic. On the other hand, dealing with these
              challenges made me improve my team communication skills and having
              to handle the teams motivational crisis gave me a lot of
              experience.

                Annotating Underwater Events of the Limfjord Through
                Crowdsourced Citizen Science
              </h2>

            <p>
              This project aims to engage people in mostly uninteresting topics
              that they do not know much about. It utilizes gamification methods
              to design a citizen science application that presents underwater
              events in an engaging way. The footage from the cameras runs
              through a motion detection algorithm that splits the video up into
              smaller video clips where an event is present. These clips are
              presented to the public through the application. The purpose of
              the application is to annotate these events, depending on what
              kind of marine life is present to create a database. The design of
              the application was twofold. First, a mental model elicitation was
              conducted in order to explore the users understanding and opinions
              of the app. Second, a test of the lo-fi prototype was carried out
              using the methods of task completion, think aloud and
              semi-structured interviews. After several alterations to the
              design a final design was drawn and implemented. In order to test
              the application, interviews and questionnaires were conducted. The
              interviews were analysed though coding and showed satisfying
              results in terms of user engagement and uncovered further room for
              research and improvement.

              <h2>Designing Calorie Counters in HIT apps for Women</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
              In this project the goal was to design a product for regularly
              exercising women between the ages of 20 and 26. After conducting a
              user-study on the target group, a calorie intake deficit was
              discovered amongst them. Therefore, a solution was designed in
              collaboration with health and fitness trainers to motivate women
              to eat a healthier number of calories. To accommodate these needs,
              we designed and implemented an app that provides a representation
              of the user’s daily caloric intake and calories they have burned.
              A prototype was implemented and tested on the target group. The
              evaluation was done by giving the users specific tasks to complete
              and asking them to answer two questionnaires. The quantitative and
              qualitative results were analysed and used to improve the app
              further.

            <p>
              This project explores the problem of decreased creativity levels
              within young children. We attempted to solve this problem by
              developing a prototype that uses modern technology to engage
              children in an artistic activity via finger painting. The
              prototype uses image processing to detect custom designed gestures
              and allows the user to paint with their fingers. The evaluation
              was focused on the technological criteria for the product, to
              ensure its proper functionality. Several ways on how the prototype
              could be improved were investigated and a user-focused evaluation
              was planned.

                Comparing Input Methods When Typing on a Virtual Keyboard in VR.

            <p>
              This project explores and compares two different ray casting input
              methods when typing on a virtual keyboard in Virtual reality.
              These two methods are hand and head-hand directed and they both
              use ray casting to display a cursor on the keyboard plane. After
              finding the most effective setup of the keyboard for both methods
              in the experimental design phase, an evaluation of the final
              product was conducted with 30 participants. The collected data was
              analysed and an insignificant difference in the Total Error Rate
              was found. However, additional variables were documented, and
              their analysis aided in finding the overall better method.
